            <h3>Today, we talk to Carol, a 74-year-old woman who reversed her diabetes. She tells us how... </h3>
       
                <p>                     Hello, this is Carol.

                    I had been suffering from type 2 diabetes for several years.
                    
                    My weight had increased, I often felt tired and I had to inject myself several times a day to monitor my blood sugar.
                    
                    Not exactly a dream life.
               
                But the saddest thing for me was when I had to turn down cake for my grandchildren's birthday party 
                    
                    and they would ask me "but grandma, why don't you eat like us?"
                <br>
                
                    <b> It broke my heart....</b> <br>

                    Not to mention the stress of going to see my doctor. Every time, he would scare me by telling me about the \
                    
                    complications of diabetes: heart disease, amputation...or even going blind!

                    The worst part, I think, was the food. Nothing tasted good anymore and I often felt like I was eating cardboard.

                    But with time, I resigned myself to it. After all, there are several diabetics in my family, so I figured it was my fate.

                    <b>Yet one day, a very good friend sent me a video.</b> She told me that diabetes could be stopped naturally.

                    Of course I was skeptical...if it was true, why hadn't my doctor told me about it?

                    But after all, I had nothing to lose so I watched this video.

                    And I must say I was very surprised!

                    Inside, I learned that an American doctor from a prestigious university had found a natural and effective way to 
                    
                    normalize blood sugar levels, using what he calls a "forgotten method".

                    And his patients manage to get rid of their diabetes, in almost 100% of the cases.

                    So I followed the recommendations of this video, without much hope I must admit.

                    During the first days, I didn't see much change, but I decided to continue anyway.

                    And after a few weeks, <br> <b> my blood sugar started to normalize:</b> I felt less tight in my pants, and I also had more energy.

                    After a few more days, I even received compliments from my husband. He told me that I looked "good". Now that's good news!

                    After a month, I had a routine appointment with my doctor. Well, he was "extremely surprised" (his words) by my blood 
                    
                    sugar numbers. I was at 103 when I went to see him, at 9:30 in the morning.

                    Since then, I'm alive again. No more prickles in my fingers, no more stress during meals.

                    And I even allowed myself some chocolate cake for my grandson's birthday. He was so happy.

                    Every day I thank God, and especially my friend, for sending me this video."
